I have developed a responsive and user-friendly E-Learning Platform using React.js, JSX, and Tailwind CSS, designed to offer a seamless educational experience for users. The core objective of this platform is to provide learners with easy access to various courses, manage their learning journey, and maintain secure user authentication. The frontend is built with React for component-based UI development and Tailwind CSS for rapid and modern styling. Routing is handled using React Router, enabling smooth navigation across multiple pages including Home, Courses, Course Details, Login, Register, and My Learning.

The application features a dynamic navbar that adapts based on the user’s authentication state. I used React Context API to manage global authentication state efficiently, allowing users to securely log in, register, or log out. Authentication status is persisted using localStorage, ensuring users remain logged in across sessions. Logged-in users can access the “My Learning” page, which displays the courses they are enrolled in, while unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page for protection.

Additional enhancements include conditional routing using Navigate, a theme toggle system using context (via ThemeProvider), and clean component structure for scalability. The entire platform is styled with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly, visually appealing layout. Future improvements include integrating a real backend, user progress tracking, and video playback features.

This project reflects my growing skills in frontend development, state management, conditional routing, and responsive design, and it lays the foundation for a full-stack learning system.
